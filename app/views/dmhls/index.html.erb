<em "font-weight: bold;">Direct-Mapping High-Level Synthesis</em> (DMHLS) 
is an novel framework for <em>High Level Synthesis</em>, 
which is extremly fast, aiming to be competitive with software compiler for microprocessors. 
DMHLS starts from LLVM Intermediate Representations (LLVM IR) and generate Verilog HDL codes. 
LLVM IR is a typical Static-Single Assignment (SSA) form of intermediate representation.
Although DMHLS only supports LLVM IR currently, the techniques underneath the framework should 
works fine for any SSA form of intermediate representations</p>

<em>High Level Synthesis</em> (HLS) has been a research topic for some three decades. Since late 1980s, 
there has been continuous effort to automating the process of RTL design by generating the 
HDL code such as Verilog HDL and VHDL automatically. Previously, HLS focused on how to optimize the 
resource usage and/or the delay for the whole work, and tread it as an optimization problem. 
Thus, some mathematical optimization models were proposed to solve the HLS problem. The earliest one of
these models might be the <em>Integer Linear Programming</em> (ILP) model, which is able to get the 
optimal solution subject to delay constraints or resource constraints. However, the ILP model is very slow
to get solution. SDC (System of Difference Constraints) is another model used to solve this optimization
problem, which is faster than ILP model, but still much slower than the software compiler.
